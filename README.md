# mkdocs-add-teaser

A MkDocs plugin to add a CSS class to the first paragraph after the first heading 1 in all pages of your project. 

This is useful if the first paragraph of your pages always contains a teaser text that should stand out from the rest of the text, e.g., printed in bold.

The name of the CSS class can be customized.
